    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>By using this site, you agree to the following terms (which are barely terms):</p>

    <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 600px; margin: 1rem auto;">
      <li>This website is purely for entertainment. Don’t expect it to do anything useful.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible if you click the button and waste 3 hours of your life.</li>
      <li>There are no guarantees that the links work, are productive, or even mildly interesting.</li>
      <li>Don’t try to sue us. There’s nothing to take anyway.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to change these terms whenever we feel like it (but probably won’t).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have concerns, just remember: it’s a button... that goes to a weird website. That’s it.</p>
